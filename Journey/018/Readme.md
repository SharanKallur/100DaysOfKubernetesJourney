# Work on Project Pace - Local installation of Kubernetes and Deploy an app and protect it with Kasten

## Introduction
[Michael Cade](https://twitter.com/michaelcade1) ([blog](https://vzilla.co.uk)) has been working on a new learning project called "Project Pace". 

The idea here being showing users how to easily setup a local Kubernetes lab environment, then setup a realistic app with data, back it up using [Kasten](https://kasten.io) and then restore data as needed.

I looked at this project and spoke to Michael about his plans and helped him out with some bits validating it on my Mac Book and also how to setup an offline capable version for when you are on the road.
## Prerequisite
[See here](https://github.com/MichaelCade/project_pace#pre-reqs)

## Use Case
A great way to get started learning or having a localised demo environment

## Research
I wrote this blog on how to perform an Air-Gap install of Kasten K10, which then helped to understand how to make this possible for the project.
